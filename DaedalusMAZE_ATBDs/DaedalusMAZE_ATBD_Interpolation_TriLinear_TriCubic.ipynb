    "## Introduction\n",
    "To simulate Daedalus measurments using physics based model such as TIEGCM \n",
    "values of gridded data have to be interpolateds to the spacecraft's positions.In\n",
    "Daedalus Maze this is provided by the Interpolation Module which is described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Interpolation Module consists of a family of  codes written in python FORTRAN and C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Input and Output\n",
    "The Interpolation Module supports Dedalus Input orbits in netcdf format and exports the interpolation\n",
    "results in netcdf as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Performance and Parallelization Level\n",
    "The python version of the Inteprolation Modules supports single threaded and multi threaded workloads using the multiprocessing library. At the same, the user can opt to call the pre-compiled low-level FORTRAN subroutines which can handle both the single threaded and the multi threaded interpolations using OpenMP.\n",
    "\n",
    "The C++ version, uses the OpenMPI and OpenMP interface and can support massive scalability on distributed memory using hybrid programming,splitting the interpolations in threads and nodes.The same basic input and output interface is used as with the python version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally there is a version of the Interpolation Module written in C++ using a CUDA kernel to speed up the interpolation process. On a shared memory environment this is by far the fastest version, outperforming the \n",

    "## Interpolation Methods\n",
    "For obtaining the interpolated data we use two different methods for comparison.These methods are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The linear interpolation method in 3-D space(trilinear) and\n",
    "\n",
    "2) The cubic spline method in 3-D space(tricubic spline).\n",
    "\n",
    "Running the code blocks below one can see the differences in these two methods, such as precision and smoothness which is a result of the tricubic spline interpolation.So lets start with the cubic spline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tricubic Spline Interpolation\n",
    "In this method we use a local (neighbors found using local function in the code below) tricubic interpolation scheme in three dimensions (TriCubicSpline function in the code).The algorithm is based on a specific $ 64 \\times 64 $ matrix (matrix A in the code blocks below) that gives the relationship between the derivatives at the corners of the elements and the coefficients of the tricubic interpolant for this element.In contrast with global interpolation where the interpolated function usually depends on the whole data set, our tricubic local interpolation only uses data in a neighbourhood of an element.The tricubic interpolation is always split in three one-dimensional problems.However, in this implementation we use three-dimensional approach.The advantages of this method are: \n",
    "\n",
    "1)The reduced computational cost\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2)and the availability of accurate derivatives (first and higher orders) of the interpolated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting interpolated function and its three first derivatives are continuous if one uses cubic interpolants.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that a function $ f $ is given at the corner of the grid (that is the TIEGCM data grid) and without losing generality we can assume a cubic element of side $ 1 $.We represent the function $ f $ as a piecewise polynomial.Inside each cube, $ f $ takes the values given by the expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(x,y,z) = \\sum_{i,j,k=0}^{3} a_{ijk}x^{i}y^{j}z^{k} \\tag{1} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "One achieves $ C^{1} $ continuity if and only if $ f $ and its three first derivatives are continuous on each of the six faces of the cubes.An obvious necessary condition is the continuity of $ f $ and the first derivatives at each of the eight corners p1, p2,...,p8 of the cube.A finite difference method can be used to extract an approximation of the derivatives of $ f $ based on nearby values of $ f $ (FirstOrderDerivative function in the code below).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this situation, the necessary condition for $ C^{1} $ continuity results in four constraints at the eight corners of each element, giving $ 32 $ constraints.We will derive the equations for the coefficients $ a_{ijk} $ in such a way that they satisfy the necessary condition ($ C^{1} $ continuity at the eight corners).\n",
    "\n",
    "The tricubic interpolation form given by Equation ($ 1 $) uses $ 64 $ coefficients and enforcing $ C^{1} $\n",
    "continuity at the eight corners only provides $ 32 $ constraints.Now we need another set of $ 32 $ constraints that must satisfy the $ C^{1} $ continuity and also be invariant under rotations of the axis x, y and z (isotropic).\n",
