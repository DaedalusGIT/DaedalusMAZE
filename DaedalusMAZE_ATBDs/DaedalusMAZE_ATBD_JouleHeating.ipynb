    "## Descriptions of Derived Products\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Joule, Ohmic, Frictional heating and Poynting Flux: \n",
    "\n",
    "The first three derived products Joule, Ohmic, and Frictional heating, in this context designate three different methods to measure the same physical process, the local dissipation of energy in the magnetized, partially ionized upper atmosphere. Because Daedalus provides the complete set of neutral wind, ion drift and electric field vectors, plus the electron density and ion composition, there are actually three such methods to derive the dissipation (Joule heating) from the combined instrument data. The methods are expected to perform differently depending on altitude and instrument characterstics, therefore all three products will be derived.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously Sangelli et al. (2009) estimated heating rates from measurements obtained with the JOULE-II sounding rocket using a method similar to the first method above. Otherwise estimation of the electromagnetic energy transfer into the LTI with satellites resorted to deriving the Poynting vector at the satellite location above the LTI (described in several publications, e.g. Cosgrove et al., 2014). For Daedalus the Poynting vector is of course also provided, and this will complement the Joule heating products particularly when the satellite is above about 150 km height. The three methods to derive heating rates and the Poynting vector address the science objective associated with the energetics of the LTI.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Magnetic Forcing\n",
    "\n",
    "Related to energetics, but distinct from it, are questions of the dynamics and momentum balance in the LTI. The corresponding Daedalus derived product is the magnetic or j ⃗×B ⃗ force, sometimes also called Lorentz force or Magnetic Forcing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Conductivities\n",
    "\n",
    "Conductivities are widely used and needed parameters, for data assimilation methods and computer simulations, the analysis of electric fields, field-aligned currents (FACs) and their closure below the height where they are typically measured. The conductivities may be presented as a 3x3 tensor σ ⃡, with Ohm’s law written as j ⃗=σ ⃡∙E ⃗. However, the tensor contains only three distinct parameters, namely the Pedersen, Hall, and parallel conductivities σ_P, σ_H, and σ_ǁ, which will be provided as Daedalus derived products. The variability of conductivities stems mainly from that of the electron density N_e, but also the neutral density N_n, the magnetic field strength B and temperature dependent ion-neutral collisional cross sections σ_in enter the equations for σ_P, σ_H, and σ_ǁ.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Ion-neutral collisional cross sections and collision frequencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Daedalus provides the measurements needed to derive Joule heating rates with a certain redundancy leading to the three different methods. Because all methods should give the same result, this allows to adjust the ion-neutral collisional cross sections σ_in and collision frequencies ν_in, which are needed in two of the methods, “Frictional” and “Ohmic” heating. σ_in and ν_in are normally taken from published tables, for example in the text book by Schunk and Nagy (2009). The values in these tables for σ_in typically originate from measurements in the laboratory, not always performed under the similar conditions as in the ionosphere (often at lower temperatures), and with measurement uncertainties. Daedalus offers the opportunity to update the values of these widely used cross sections. In a sense it repeats these laboratory measurements but under ionospheric conditions. In practice this will give results mainly near the peak of the Joule heating rate at about 120 km altitude, plus/minus about a scale height (≈9 km).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Heating by electron impact ionization\n",
    "\n",
    "Ionization and recombination in the LTI produces heat (in addition to the Joule heating which is the main theme of the Daedalus mission). The main causes of the ionization are the global absorption of solar EUV radiation, wavelengths 10-120 nm, and the collisional impact of energetic particles, mainly electrons, from space at high latitudes. Under the condition that convection is negligible the local heat production can be estimated from the measured N_e using model values for the recombination coefficients (confirm Bates, 1988) and a representative number of the heat produced per ionization and recombination. Laboratory measurements have suggested that this number is about 34 eV for electron impact (Rees, 1989). Although unconfirmed one can assume that even in case of ionospheric ionization by EUV also roughly 34 eV of heat are dissipated. The Daedalus product can be compared and will complement measurements of the EUV flux (Kazachevskaya et al., 2004) and of the energetic electron particle flux on satellites above the LTI (including Daedalus itself), and the F10.7 at the ground, which is a proxy for the EUV flux.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Heat transfer to the neutral gas by ion and electron cooling\n",
    "\n",
    "The friction between ions and neutrals as well as ionization results in different temperatures of ions, electrons and the neutral gas, and collisional heat transfer between these components. The rates can be derived from observed temperatures and collisional cross sections. Among other this product provides additional consistency checks for other products: the cooling rate of ions to neutrals should be roughly half of the Joule heating, and that of electrons to neutrals and ions should nearly match the heating estimate described in the previous section.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. Field-aligned currents\n",
    "\n",
    "Field-aligned currents are a standard product of satellites possessing a magnetometer, and methods to derive FACs are well established. Daedalus will adopt the single spacecraft method used for the corresponding Swarm products.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8. Total Electron Content (TEC)\n",

    "The slanted and vertical TEC are standard products when GNSS signals are received. \n",
