'''
Creates a CSV file with the format [Time, Lat, Lon, Alt]
Time and Alt are fixed values given as arguments and Lat and Lon are produced for the whole globe accodring to steps specified.
CSVfilename: string, the csv filename to be written (overwrite mode)
fixedDatetimeString: string, the date-time fixed text with format as example: "17 Mar 2015 00:12:00.000". Fixed value for every csv entry. If this is an empty string then no file is created and empty string and zeros are returned.
fixedAltitude: float positive, kilometers above earth. Fixed value for every csv entry.
LatitudeStep: float positive, Latiude values range between 87.5 and -88.5. The step is how Lat should be incremented at each iteration.
LongitudeStep: float positive, Longitude values range between -180 and 180.  The step is how Lon should be incremented at each iteration.
RETURNS: the filename it has written (same as the argument)
         the altitude (same as the argument)
         the number of lines written
